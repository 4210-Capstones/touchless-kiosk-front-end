It is designed to integrate seamlessly with the [Touchless-Kiosk-Server](https://github.com/4210-Capstones/touchless-kiosk-server), enabling users to interact with various features such as viewing Research and UNO Partners, request forms, booking systens, and tutoring servicesâ€”all through a touchless interface.
